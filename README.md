# Virgo-frontend

Frontend for the virgo chat app built with React

## Installation

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

- Install nvm (Node Version Manager) -- very recommended because this project uses a very old version of node and npm ([docs here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))
```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
```
- Then use nvm to install version 10: `nvm install 10`
- Clone the project, cd into the directory
- Run `nvm use 10`
- Run `npm install`
- Create .env file by running: `cp .env.example .env`
- Start the application `npm start`
- Go to localhost:3000 to use the app!

## Backend

Run together with the `virgo-backend` project to make it work.
